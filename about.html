      <h2>(Quick) About</h2>
      <p>
        Start with nothing but an axe, chop down some trees, sell logs, and hire workers to do stuff for you.
      </p>

      <h2>Controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Movement: <b>Arrows</b> or <b>WASD</b></li>
        <li>Interact with objects / Use selected item: <b>SPACE</b></li>
        <li>Select item slot: Numbers <b>1 - 8</b></li>
        <li>Sell an item: <b>Right-Click</b> on the item in your inventory</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How To Play</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Walk up to a tree and press <b>SPACE</b> several times to chop it down.
          <br />
          <i>(You will be able to buy an upgraded axe later in the game's devlopment to make chopping trees easier.)</i>
        </li>
        <li>Collect the item(s) the tree dropped.</li>
        <li>Sell the log.</li>
        <li>If you didn't sell the pine cone, you can plant it by pressing <b>SPACE</b> on an empty tile.</li>
        <li>After you've made some money, hire a worker. They'll get to work right away.</li>
        <li>When you don't need a worker anymore, fire them.</li>
        <li>If you hire a Collector, don't forget to sell the logs they pick up for you.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Workers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must pay a deposit to hire a worker (different workers have different deposit amounts)</li>
        <li>Workers charge a small fee whenever</li>
        <li>
          <b>Choppers</b> will chop down trees
          <br />
          Deposit: <b>$150</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Collectors</b> will collect items on the ground and magically place them in your inventory
          <br />
          Deposit: <b>$50</b>
          <ul>
            <li>If you can't hold anymore of an item, Collectors will just stand in front of the item trying to pick it up (bug)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Planters</b> will magically take pine cones from your inventory and plant them in inconvenient places
          <br />
          Deposit: <b>$75</b>
          <ul>
            <li>They also like to trap themselves and/or other workers among the trees they planted</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Shortcuts</h2>
      <p>For keyboard people like myself.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pause/Resume the game: <b>P</b></li>
        <li>Previous / Next item slot: <b>Q</b> / <b>E</b></li>
        <li>Sell selected item: <b>L</b></li>
        <li>Sell all of selected item: <b>SHIFT</b> + <b>L</b>/<b>Right-Click</b></li>
        <li>Hire selected worker type: <b>H</b></li>
        <li>Fire selected worker type: <b>F</b></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Other Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There are no mobile controls at the moment. If anyone has any ideas for how the controls should work let me know and I'll add them.</li>
        <li>Workers are pretty dumb at the moment.</li>
        <li>The game will pause if the page is not visible.</li>
        <li>You'll eventually run out of trees and pine cones.</li>
        <li>There are more item slots than there are items in the game.</li>
        <li>Water is currently useless. It's from an old idea for the game. It says you can collect it but you can't unless you have a bucket (which you can't acquire).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Feedback Wanted</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Debt
          <ul>
            <li>What incentive could the player have to pay off their debt?</li>
            <li>Does it feel balanced having workers add to the debt when they do work?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          UI
          <ul>
            <li>What colors do you think would improve the UI?</li>
          </ul>
