      | A small experimental game attempting to bring typical 
      a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game' target='_blank') incremental game
      |  mechanics to a game where you control the character instead of solely clicking buttons.
    p
      | Chop down trees, sell logs, chop down more trees, upgrade your axe and stuff, chop down more trees, sell more logs, hire workers to help out. 
      | Basically the same things you would do in any incremental game like

      | .
    p
      | I think the game is fun and I had fun making it, but I won't be doing anymore significant work on this game. 
      | I certainly have plans to explore this idea more, but I'd rather start fresh and design a new game based on what I learned here.
    
    p You can view and change controls in the Settings -> Controls menu.

    ul
      li Walk up to a tree and hold SPACE with your axe selected to start chopping it down.
      li Pick up what the tree drops.
        ul
          li Sell the log.
          li If it drops a pine cone, you can plant it by pressing SPACE on some grass (with the pine cone selected). It'll grow into a tree after a while.
            ul
              li If you really want some more cash, you can sell pine cones too (they don't sell for much though).
      li Buy some upgrades in the Upgrades tab.
      li Once you have enough money, you can hire workers (in the Workers tab).
        ul
          li Choppers will chop down any trees they can find.
          li Collectors will pick up items and put them in your inventory. (You still need to sell the logs and plant the pine cones though).
          li You can upgrade workers in their respective menus.
  div#bugs-menu.col-xs-9.hidden
    p I'm aware of a number of issues in the game. If enough people like the game I'll polish things up.
    ul
      li There are no mobile controls.
      li Performance could be better.
      li Upgrades could use some more tweaking I think.
      li There's (possibly still) a bug that causes workers to just stop moving and stand still. Refreshing the page will fix it (but will reset the world and workers).
      li The world and your workers aren't saved. I figured this was a way to get around the fact that there's a finite supply of trees and keep the game playable without fully resetting.
      li There are 8 inventory slots and only 3 items you can get. (I had slightly bigger plans for this game at one point and didn't remove the extra slots)
      li Controls are bit screwy at times.
      li The UI could be better.
